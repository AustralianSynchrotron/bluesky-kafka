The build process is not currently automated as the codebase is public but the pypi repo is private.
We are not currently publishing a public package.

One day we will hopefully automate this.

::
    # First make a commit with the version and tag it
    $ git commit -m "REL: v0.11.0"
    $ git push
    $ git tag v0.11.0
    $ git push --tags

::
    # This repo doesn't currently use poetry or uv, so use a venv to install the build dependencies
    $ python -m venv .venv
    $ . .venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install wheel twine setuptools
    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

::
    # Log into our local pypi repo
    $ devpi login <usename>
    $ devpi use <asci prod index>

::
    # Try it out without actually uploading anything
    $ devpi upload --dry-run --from-dir dist/

    # If that looks good, actually upload it.
    $ devpi upload --from-dir dist/
